# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Rosen's favorite game
TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that will have a character uploaded with the intention of dodging objects as they float around. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software will be an interactive game where a snake moves freely across the screen and dodgers any stuff. The player’s goal is to control the snake to dodge
any obstacle, if it does it hit an obstacle or the wall, the game will end. This game is mainl about survival and using the player’s reflexes. Some key 
features that we will be using are, free flowing snake movement, obstacle generation, collision detection, keyboard input, score/time tracker, and a restart option.  
Our software will be able to start the game at the psuh of a button and 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate 
to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
N/A
## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A working game window. Free flowing snake movement. Keyboard contols. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A pause and resume feature. High quality graphics. Background music or sound effects reacting to collison or the failure to complete the intended goal. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Different levels of difficulty. Two player mode. Adding game to multiple platforms. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one
of two classmates, who will do what?

Already we know how to use variables, loops, conditionals, functions, lists, turtle graphics, and simple file handling modules. 
To complete this game, we would need new skills such as using Pygame, designing a game loop, 
putting in collision detection, creating a score counter/timer, and managing objects on screens. Some topics we 
would need to research on to help for this are, how to install and use Pygame, how to move a shape or image smoothly across a 
screen, how to detect when 2 objects touch, how to track/time or score in Python, how to add a restart button, and for the best 
outcome how to add sound effects or background music.
